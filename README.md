# Socket Chat
_A socket.io node/browser chat system_

## The rest of this README is devoid of information

This is a simple chat program with a simple philosophy:

> "Rumors of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated." - Captain Jean-Luc Picard

Jean-Luc taught us to move fast and say things. He was renowned for saying things all over the place -- often where no one had said anything before. Occasionally in time travel episodes, or the Q Continuum.

Now you, too, can say things. In places. That's right, you can say them using Socket Chat, the inspiringly creatively named tutorialistic endeavour placed tantalizingly close at hand! Just 'git clone' it, run 'npm install' or whatever, then 'node index.js', and voila! Chats. Maybe you should fork it and work on your own crazy modifications! Whoa!!!

Actually, that's probably not a very reasonable idea. It's pretty much just the suggested code from http://socket.io/get-started/chat/, plus some of the keener-addons toward the bottom. It'll grow some more of those as time goes on. But then it'll be dead. So dead, not even a genesis device could bring it back.

I sincerely hope no one has read this, and I'm sorry if you did,

Wyatt Carss
